# driversedalarm

- I need to use driversed.com to get my driver's license.
- Turns out the app gives you tons of unskippable text to read in way too much time.
- If you idle or don't check the screen, it will also delete much of your progress

Inserting this code in the console of your browser will play an alarm when the timer hits zero and you need to click next before you lose your progress.
